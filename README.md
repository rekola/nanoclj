## A Tiny Clojure Interpreter

This is a small Clojure language implementation written in C
language. It is based on TinyScheme which was based on MiniScheme. The
project is in the early stages yet, and much functionality is still
missing. The project has two main goals:

1. Provide data visualization capabilities for the REPL in a terminal or GUI.
2. Provide an embedded Clojure interpreter for C++ applications as an alternative for Lua and other scripting languages.

An additional long term goal is to bring AI assistance right in to the REPL.

## Features

- Terminal graphics (*Kitty* or *Sixel* protocols) with HiDPI support
- Image, audio, Shapefile, XML, CSV and GraphML loading
- Simple image operations (blur, transpose etc.) and 2D canvas
- REPL output is colored by type
- Callback Writer for printing into a GUI instead of stdout
- Class and namespace names try to imitate Java and Clojure names when possible (e.g. `(type 1) ;=> java.lang.Long`)
- BigInts and Ratios
- Tensors are used for representing most data structures. For example, a vector is a 1D tensor of doubles (with NaN-packing for other data types).
- Test framework

### 2D Graphics

Since Clojure has no standard way for 2D drawing, a new system has
been created for nanoclj. The principle of minimality suggests that
there should only be a single way to output text, which means that
println must work with canvas. Therefore, an active canvas is bound to
`*out*` and it's the target of all canvas operations. For normal `*out*`
the canvas commands are ignored (apart from color and restore), but
one could imagine that they could be used to draw vector graphics on a
Tektronix terminal, or move-to could set the cursor position in a text
mode program. The canvas interface has been modeled after Cairo.

In GUI program the resulting canvas can be displayed in a REPL using
the GUI callbacks for output Writer. In terminal program Kitty or
Sixel protocol is used to print the results of a function call when
the function returns a canvas or image. The terminal must, of course,
need to support Kitty or Sixel graphics and support must be
enabled. The following terminals have been tested:

| Terminal | Graphics | Mouse | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| foot | OK | OK | Wayland only, no undercurls |
| kitty | OK | ? | True color images, but window resizing has bugs (as of 0.26.5) |
| wezterm | OK | OK | Buggy (as of 20230712) |
| mlterm | OK | ? | linenoise output flickers when updated, no undercurls |
| Konsole | OK | ? | True color images, but on HiDPI system images are upscaled |
| contour | Inline image layout doesn't work | ? | |
| xterm | No true color	| OK | No undercurls, Sixel support must be enabled in `.Xresources` |
| Black Box | Inline image layout doesn't work | ? | On HiDPI system the images are upscaled, and the terminal and the flatpak system use too much CPU time when idling. |
| Alacritty | None | ? | |
| GNOME Terminal | None | ? | Sixel support is not enabled by default |
| mintty | ? | ? | Not tested yet. |

*The plot function returns a canvas, which can be saved with nanoclj.image/save or modified using other functions in the nanoclj.image namespace.*

As well as printing images in block mode like the plot function does, they can also be printed in inline mode which is shown in the following example:

## Differences to Clojure:

- Characters are 32 bit, strings are UTF-8 (count is O(n)), UTF8 validity is checked and char-array creates a byte array
- Strings are sequences, and they are compared and sorted as such.
- List count has complexity of O(n)
- Macros use the TinyScheme syntax
- Tail-call optimization
- sort is not stable and doesn't support custom compare function
- License is BSD 3-Clause License instead of EPL
- Symbols are interned but are temporarily boxed when metadata is added
- Primitives such as doubles and small integers are passed by value, and are in effect, interned
- Regular expressions are interned, but strings are not: `(identical? "abc" "abc") ;=> false`
- `rationalize` returns exact result for doubles: `(rationalize 0.1) ;=> 3602879701896397/36028797018963968`
- No chunked or buffered lazy sequences
- Data structures are only partially persistent, and while vectors, maps and sets allow fast reading and insertion, deletion and modification is slow.
- Namespaces can only contain Vars, not Classes: `(resolve 'Math) ;=> #'java.lang.Math`
- Arrays are compared by value, can only contain primitive values (including Objects) and multidimensional arrays cannot be ragged
- No type hints
- Unbound Vars cannot be created
- Dividing Long/MIN_VALUE by -1 doesn't fail
- java.net.URL doesn't resolve the hostname for calculating hashcode
- No transient data structures

## Building

C11 support is required for building nanoclj, and it has been tested with both gcc and clang. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.

### Ubuntu

```
sudo apt install libutf8proc-dev libsixel-dev libpcre2-dev libcairo2-dev libshp-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libz-dev
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

### Arch Linux PKGBUILD

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rekola/nanoclj/main/PKGBUILD -O
makepkg -si
```

### Windows

Windows support is in progress.
